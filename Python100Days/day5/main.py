48 - Using loop with python Lists
Loop allows to the execute lines of code multiple times
'''
def forloop():
  fruits = ["Apple", "Peach", "Pear"]
  # taking the list fruits and use the var fruit to assign each value in fruits
  for fruit in fruits:

49 - Coding Exercise Average Height
RULES: CANNOT use Python functions: sum(iter) and len(list)
FORMAT:
  for item in itemList:
    # do something for each item
INSTRUCTIONS:
You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.
The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.
e.g.
180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146
There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights

1146 รท 7 = 163.71428571428572
Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164
'''
def averageStudentHeights():
  studentHeights = input("Input a list of student heights cm: ").split()
  for num in range(0, len(studentHeights)):
    studentHeights[num] = int(studentHeights[num])

  studentTotal = 0
  heightTotal = 0
  for height in studentHeights:
    heightTotal += height
    studentTotal += 1

  averageHeight = round(heightTotal/studentTotal)
  print(f"There are total of {studentTotal} heights at an average of {averageHeight} cm.")

def averageStudentHeights2():
  studentHeights = input("Input a list of student heights: ").split()
  for n in range(0, len(studentHeights)):
    studentHeights[n] = int(studentHeights[n])

  averageHeight = round(heightTotal/studentTotal)

RULES: CANNOT use Python functions: max(iterable), min(iterable)

51 - for loops and range() function
# Sometimes we might want to use a loop completely 'independent' of a list
CARL GAUSS GENIUS EXERCISE: ADD ALL the numbers from 1 TO 100
He flipped the numbers around, add the two lines = 101, 50 pairs x 101 = 5050 GENIUS
1   + 2  +  3 + ... + 98 + 99 + 100
100 + 99 + 98 + ... + 3  + 2  + 1

- Can shorten this with the range function: range(start,stop,step)
- Use range function if you want to generate a (range of numbers to loop through)
SYNTAX:
for number in range(a,b): #[inclusive-exclusive)
    print(number) #each number in that range do something with that number
'''

  #for num in range(1,11): # 1 - 10

51 - CODING EXERCISE FIZZBUZZ
- You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.
- Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn
- When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".
- `When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`
- `And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"`
