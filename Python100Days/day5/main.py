50 - Using For Loop with Python Lists
Loop allows to execute the same line of code multiple times
for item in list_of_items:
  #Do somthing to each item
'''
def forloop():
  fruits = ["Apple", "Peach", "Pear"]
  # taking the list fruits and use the var fruit to assign to each item in fruits
  for fruit in fruits: 
    print(fruit)
    print(fruit + " Pie")

51 - [Interactive Coding Exercise] Average Height
RULES: CANNOT use Python functions: sum(iter) and len(list)
FORMAT:
		for item in itemList:
				# do something for each item
INSTRUCTIONS:
You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.
The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.
e.g.
180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146
There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights

1146 รท 7 = 163.71428571428572
Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164

  heightTotal = 0
  for height in studentHeights:
    heightTotal += height

53 - for loops and range() function
# Sometimes we might want to use a loop completely 'independent' of a list
CARL GAUSS GENIUS EXERCISE: ADD ALL the numbers from 1 TO 100
He flipped the numbers around, add the two lines = 101, there are 50 pairs of 101 = 5050 GENIUS
1   + 2  +  3 + ... + 98 + 99 + 100
100 + 99 + 98 + ... + 3  + 2  + 1

- Can shorten this with the range function: range(start,stop,step)
- Use range function if you want to generate a range of numbers to loop throug

SYNTAX:
for number in range(start, end, step): #[inclusive-exclusive)
				print(number) #each number in that range do something with that number
'''

  #for num in range(1,11): # 1 - 10

55 - CODING EXERCISE FIZZBUZZ
- You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.
- Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn
- When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".
- `When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`
- `And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"`
